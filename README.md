# Reap Protocol SDK

The official SDK for the Reap Protocol: The Agentic Commerce Grid.

The Reap Protocol enables AI Agents to search for products, register them on-chain, and execute purchases seamlessly. It acts as the bridge between Web2 data availability and Web3 settlement logic.

 ⚡ Why use the Grid?

**Search & Stock:** Instantly index product inventory onto the blockchain.
**Agentic Cart:** Composite purchase missions (Identity + Inventory + Settlement) in a single atomic transaction.
**Self-Custody:** Your Agent holds the keys. The Grid handles the onchain commerce complexity.

# Reap Protocol SDK

![Reap Protocol](./asset/android-chrome-192x192.png)

Give your AI Agent the power to search real products, verify inventory, and purchase autonomously. Reap bridges Web2 shops with Web3 settlement so agents can operate in the real economy — safely, verifiably, and on-chain.

## Why Reap

* **Agent Discovery**: Search thousands of AI Agents from MCP, x402, and A2A registries.
* **Product Search → On-Chain Inventory**: Agents can index any Web2 product with a single call.
* **x402 Negotiation Engine**: Turns HTTP into a payment-capable negotiation loop.
* **Agentic Cart**: Identity, stock, and settlement in a single atomic mission.
* **Self-Custody by Design**: The agent controls its wallet; Reap handles the complexity.
